description: Instrumented Alert Production pipeline for test dataset
#
# This pipeline delegates to per-task config files to ensure consistency with Gen 2.
# The config files can be merged into this once ap_verify no longer supports Gen 2.
#
# This pipeline does not depend on the local ApPipe.yaml, because the definition
# of the primary ApVerify.yaml is more likely to change than the data-specific
# overrides, and importing both pipelines can't merge changes to the same task.
